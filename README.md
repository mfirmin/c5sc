##Composing Colossal Collections of Connected Controllers for Simulated Characters (c5sc)

###Description
This project consists of refactoring and improving my [MSc work](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mfirmin/research.php) on creating a simple scripting language for facilitating the design of controllers for simulated humanoids.

The end goal is to create a framework that is easily crowd sourced, where users can easily create and submit motion controllers. Then, the system could automatically find transitions between the newly submitted, and existing motions.

As a starting point, I've branched off of this project to another repository, [Four](https://github.com/mfirmin/four). Inspired by three.js, this is meant to be a library for creating and viewing 3D simulated worlds and characters. When I'm happy with that project, I'll come back to this one!
